Blocks wire audiocn-svelte components to the Web Audio hooks. Each one installs everything it needs in one command, and after that the code is yours: it has few props and is meant to be edited.

| Block                                                       | What it is                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [System Audio Mixer](/docs/blocks/system-audio-mixer)       | Microphone, system audio, music, sound pads and a master, running on Web Audio |
| [Microphone Setup](/docs/blocks/mic-setup)                  | Device select, live preview, meter, gain, mute and a level check               |
| [System Audio Settings](/docs/blocks/system-audio-settings) | On/off capture, level, meter and what the browser will capture                 |
| [Quick Audio Popover](/docs/blocks/quick-audio-popover)     | Microphone and system audio controls behind one toolbar button                 |
| [Soundboard](/docs/blocks/soundboard)                       | Sound pads with hotkeys, modes, volume and drag-and-drop                       |
| [Music Player](/docs/blocks/music-player)                   | Playlist, waveform seek bar, shuffle, repeat and ducking                       |

<Callout title="Demo audio">

The previews play music and sound effects synthesised in your browser, so no
audio files ship with the site. In your app, pass your own tracks and sounds.
