title: Electric Bar Visualizer
description: Frequency-band bars drawn as crackling filaments, with arcs between loud neighbours and sparks on sudden rises.

<script>
	import { ComponentPreview, PropsTable } from "#lib/docs/components/index.js";
</script>

<ComponentPreview name="electric-bar-visualizer-demo" />

## Installation

```npm
npx shadcn-svelte@latest add @audiocn-svelte/electric-bar-visualizer
```

## Usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { ElectricBarVisualizer } from "#lib/components/ui/electric-bar-visualizer/index.js";
</script>

<ElectricBarVisualizer
	aria-label="Voice activity"
	class="h-24 text-primary"
	source={analyser.visual}
/>
```

It takes the same data and props as the [bar visualizer](/docs/components/bar-visualizer), so you can swap one for the other. The electric look comes from the shape and the motion, not from a fixed colour: the bars follow the text colour, so they turn with your theme. In dark mode the core runs white-hot.

The visualizer fills its container, so size it with classes. It paints on the animation frame without going through Svelte state, redraws on resize and picks up theme changes on its own.

## Examples

### Colors

Set the text color, or `--electric`, to any theme color.

<ComponentPreview name="electric-bar-visualizer-colors" />

### Intensity, arcs and sparks

`intensity` sets how jagged and restless the filaments are. `arcs` jump between loud neighbouring bars and `sparks` fly off the tips when a level rises quickly.

<ComponentPreview name="electric-bar-visualizer-intensity" />

### Idle and loading

`idle` decides what bars do without a signal. `loading` runs an arc along the bars, for connecting or thinking states.

## Theming

| Variable or attribute  | Meaning                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--electric`           | Filament color, default `currentColor`                                           |
| `--electric-core`      | Core and tip color, default `--electric` mixed toward white by `--electric-heat` |
| `--electric-heat`      | How white-hot the core runs, default `0%` in light mode and `70%` in dark mode   |
| `--electric-glow`      | Glow color, default `--electric`                                                 |
| `--electric-glow-size` | Glow blur, default `0.5rem`                                                      |
| `data-active`          | The signal is above the floor                                                    |
| `data-loading`         | The loading arc is running                                                       |
| `data-align`           | Where bars grow from                                                             |

The variables can be set from a class, such as `[--electric-heat:40%]`, or globally.

## Accessibility

The root has `role="img"` and the label "Audio visualizer". Pass `aria-label` to describe what it shows, or `aria-hidden` when it is decorative next to a labelled meter.

The flicker changes brightness by at most 12%, only on thin strokes, and each jagged shape holds for at least 40 ms, so nothing flashes across a large area. With reduced motion the bars are straight and still, with no arcs, sparks or flicker, and redraw four times a second.

### Exported functions

Bind the component with `bind:this` to call them. Their type is `ElectricBarVisualizerActions`.
