title: Electric Waveform
description: One electric line across the width, with a crackling white-hot core, a tall glow, forks off the peaks and sparks.

<script>
	import { ComponentPreview, PropsTable } from "#lib/docs/components/index.js";
</script>

<ComponentPreview name="electric-waveform-demo" />

## Installation

```npm
npx shadcn-svelte@latest add @audiocn-svelte/electric-waveform
```

## Usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { ElectricWaveform } from "#lib/components/ui/electric-waveform/index.js";
</script>

<ElectricWaveform aria-label="Voice activity" class="h-32 text-primary" source={analyser.visual} />
```

The line follows the text colour, so it changes with your theme, and in dark mode its core runs white-hot. It shares its look and variables with the [electric bar visualizer](/docs/components/electric-bar-visualizer).

The waveform fills its container, so size it with classes. It paints on the animation frame without going through Svelte state, redraws on resize and picks up theme changes on its own.

## Examples

### Wave and scope

`wave` draws a smooth wave shaped by the frequency bands, calm enough for a voice assistant. `scope` draws the signal itself, like an oscilloscope, and starts each frame on a rising zero crossing so steady tones stand still.

<ComponentPreview name="electric-waveform-modes" />

### Intensity, arcs and sparks

`intensity` sets how jagged and restless the line is. `arcs` fork off the peaks and `sparks` fly when the level rises quickly.

<ComponentPreview name="electric-waveform-intensity" />

### Idle and loading

With no signal the line rests flat and hums. `loading` runs a pulse along it, for connecting or thinking states.

## Theming

| Variable or attribute  | Meaning                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--electric`           | Line color, default `currentColor`                                             |
| `--electric-core`      | Core color, default `--electric` mixed toward white by `--electric-heat`       |
| `--electric-heat`      | How white-hot the core runs, default `0%` in light mode and `70%` in dark mode |
| `--electric-glow`      | Glow color, default `--electric`                                               |
| `--electric-glow-size` | Glow blur, default `0.5rem`                                                    |
| `data-mode`            | `wave` or `scope`                                                              |
| `data-active`          | The signal is above the floor                                                  |
| `data-loading`         | The loading pulse is running                                                   |

## Accessibility

The root has `role="img"` and the label "Audio waveform". Pass `aria-label` to describe what it shows, or `aria-hidden` when it is decorative next to a labelled meter.

The flicker changes brightness by at most 12% and each jagged shape holds for at least 40 ms, so nothing flashes. With reduced motion the line is smooth and still, with no crackle, forks or sparks, and redraws four times a second.
