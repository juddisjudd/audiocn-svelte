title: Smooth Waveform
description: One clean line across the width that follows the sound, as a flowing wave or an oscilloscope trace.

<script>
	import { ComponentPreview, PropsTable } from "#lib/docs/components/index.js";
</script>

<ComponentPreview name="smooth-waveform-demo" />

## Installation

```npm
npx shadcn-svelte@latest add @audiocn-svelte/smooth-waveform
```

## Usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { SmoothWaveform } from "#lib/components/ui/smooth-waveform/index.js";
</script>

<SmoothWaveform aria-label="Voice activity" class="h-24 text-primary" source={analyser.visual} />
```

The line takes its color from the text color. It is the plain version of the [electric waveform](/docs/components/electric-waveform): the same shape, with no crackle, glow or sparks.

The waveform fills its container, so size it with classes. It paints on the animation frame without going through Svelte state, redraws on resize and picks up theme changes on its own.

## Examples

### Wave and scope

`wave` draws a smooth wave shaped by the frequency bands, calm enough for a voice assistant. `scope` draws the signal itself, like an oscilloscope, and starts each frame on a rising zero crossing so steady tones stand still.

<ComponentPreview name="smooth-waveform-modes" />

### Idle and loading

With no signal the line rests flat. `loading` runs a pulse along it, for connecting or thinking states.

<ComponentPreview name="smooth-waveform-states" />

### Microphone

<ComponentPreview name="smooth-waveform-microphone" />

## Theming

| Variable or attribute | Meaning                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--waveform`          | Line color, default `currentColor` |
| `data-mode`           | `wave` or `scope`                  |
| `data-active`         | The signal is above the floor      |
| `data-loading`        | The loading pulse is running       |

## Accessibility

The root has `role="img"` and the label "Audio waveform". Pass `aria-label` to describe what it shows, or `aria-hidden` when it is decorative next to a labelled meter. With reduced motion the wave stops drifting and the line redraws four times a second.

### Exported functions

Bind the component with `bind:this` to call them. Their type is `SmoothWaveformActions`.

<PropsTable
	rows={[
		["paint", "(frame: VisualFrame) => void", null, "Paint a frame directly."],
		["clear", "() => void", null, "Forget the last frame, so the line falls flat."],
	]}
