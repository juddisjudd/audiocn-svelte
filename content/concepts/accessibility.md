## Meters

- Level meters have `role="meter"` and report their value in dB, such as "−12.0 dB". Screen readers get updates at most four times a second, so they are not flooded.
- Give every meter a name with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Visualizers have `role="img"`. Mark decorative ones `aria-hidden` when a labelled meter sits next to them.
- A clip indicator announces "Clipping" politely, once per clip.

## Controls

Faders, parameter sliders, knobs, pan controls and seek bars are sliders with a readable `aria-valuetext`: "−6.0 dB", "Silent", "30% left", "1:24 of 3:40". They share one keyboard map:

| Key                                | Action            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Arrow keys                         | One step          |
| Shift + arrow, Page Up / Page Down | A large step      |
| Alt + arrow                        | A fine step       |
| Home / End                         | Minimum / maximum |

Double-clicking resets a fader, knob or pan control; `FaderReset` and `ParameterSliderReset` give the same action a keyboard path.

Mute, solo and monitor toggles are buttons with `aria-pressed`.

## Mixers and lists

- Strips are named groups. Ctrl + arrow keys move focus to the same control on the next strip; Tab still reaches everything in order.
- Track lists and sound pad grids move focus with the arrow keys.
- Sound pad hotkeys are announced with `aria-keyshortcuts` and never fire while someone is typing in a field.

## Colour is never the only signal

Muted, soloed and clipping states also show as pressed toggles, labels or shapes. Zone colours sit on top of a level you can read without them.

## Reduced motion

With `prefers-reduced-motion`, meters and visualizers stop animating and show the current level four times a second. Idle animations and sweeps turn off.
