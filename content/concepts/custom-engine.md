title: Using your own audio engine
description: Drive audiocn-svelte from a native backend, a WebSocket, a worker or anything else.

The Web Audio hooks are optional. If your audio runs somewhere else, such as a Rust or C++ engine in a desktop app, a server, or an `AudioWorklet`, use the components and the audio core on their own.

## Levels from anywhere

Wrap your data in a frame source with `createFrameEmitter`:

```ts
import { createFrameEmitter } from "#lib/audio/frame-source.js";
import type { MeterFrame } from "#lib/audio/types.js";

export const micLevels = createFrameEmitter<MeterFrame>();

backend.on("levels", ({ peakDb, rmsDb }) => {
	micLevels.emit({ channels: [{ peakDb, rmsDb }] });
});
```

```svelte
<LevelMeter aria-label="Microphone" source={micLevels} />
```

Meters apply their own ballistics, so any update rate works: at 30 updates a second or more they look like a hardware meter, and at one a second they still move smoothly.

## Controls to anywhere

Controls report values; they never touch audio. Send changes to your engine:

```svelte
<Fader
	bind:value={micGainDb}
	onValueChange={(gainDb) => backend.setGain("mic", gainDb)}
	onValueCommit={(gainDb) => settings.save({ micGainDb: gainDb })}
/>
```

Use `onValueChange` for live updates and `onValueCommit` for anything slow, such as saving settings.

## Mixer state without Web Audio

[`useMixer`](/docs/hooks/use-mixer) holds gain, mute, solo, pan and monitor for every channel and knows which channels are audible. Send its state to your engine:

```ts
const mixer = useMixer(() => ({
	channels,
	onStateChange: (state) => backend.applyMixer(state),
}));
```

## Devices from anywhere

[`AudioDeviceSelect`](/docs/components/audio-device-select) takes its devices as a prop, including their status, so a native device list works the same as the browser's.

## Swapping sources

If the audio behind a meter restarts, use a relay so components keep their subscription:

```ts
import { createFrameRelay } from "#lib/audio/frame-source.js";

const relay = createFrameRelay<MeterFrame>();
relay.setSource(currentSession.levels);
```
